## Introduction
LIFT is a mesoscopic model for urban traffic considering its interrupted flow dynamics. It overcomes the challenges in macroscopic modeling and has lower computation requirement compared to microscopic simulation.

## Building the network
The sample codes are using a virtual case study network, as shown in the picture below. The detailed information, including the OD path composition and inflow demand, can be found in the research paper at the bottom of the page.
